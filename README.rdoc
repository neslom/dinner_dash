Dinner Dash is an online restaurant marketplace built with Ruby on Rails, specializing in the sale of toast products.
This project is a standard CRUD shopping site using RESTful conventions.

My focus was on TDD, pair programming, and utilizing a session-based cart.

This is the Second Module project at the Turing School of Software Development and Design.

Team consisted of Mac McCarthy, Kyra Steenbock, and Markus Olsen.
